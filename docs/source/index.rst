Welcome to tlsfuzzer!
=====================

``tlsfuzzer`` is a framework for testing SSL and TLS implementations.

It allows for testing standards-compliance of a given implementation, testing
for presence of known vulnerabilities as well as fuzzing of the SSL and TLS
connections.

Ready-to-use scripts are already provided for testing significant parts of
the TLS protocols.
